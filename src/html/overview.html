                            Hello. I'm assuming since you came to this page that you wanted to get to know a little bit about me.
                            My names Bobbylee Ingalls, but you can just call me Bobby. I picked up scripting and programing around
                            October 2017 but I've been in the technology business since August 2016. The experience I like most
                            when it comes to programming and scripting is you will never stop learning. Everyday new technologies
                            provide oportunities to spread out and fill the "think-tank" with something new. With this I say to you
                            "Don't let yourself down. Always press to learn and do more. When you stop believing you can learn more,
                            you cheat yourself from valuable experience.".

                    <p class="subtitle">
                        Well, I was born at... Ha! you thought I was going to go way back. No I'll start with the basis of how 
                        I've got where I am today. 
                        <br><br>
                        In highschool I wasn't the most popular kid nor the nerd. I was your typical adverage teenager. Worked
                        hard to keep my grades at a standard my parents set and hung out with my friends when I could. Found
                        the occasional trouble from acting before thinking but you get the drift. In these days I did play alot
                        of Diablo and StarCraft on my mothers old Windows 98. Held up like a champ she did. Hell, I think it 
                        wasn't until Windows 7 that my mother finally retired that desk rock. Either way, in these days I was
                        continuously being told by my parents to strive towads technology because I seemed to pick up on it 
                        rather quickly. Now to move forward to after High School.
                        <br><br>
                        I didn't take the scholarship route as most of my classmates did. Instead I choose to pickup arms and
                        join the United States military. The War on Terrorism was the propoganda at the time. Seemed right.
                        Thought I'd serve my country and contribute to society. Turns out I found myself working on the KC-135
                        StratoTanker for the United States Air Force. 6 years of turning wrenches and never eneding refuels. It
                        was a great experience. Was able to see parts of the world I have yet to re-experience thus far. If I
                        had to give a suggestion on this for those looking into the United States Air Force, Do it. It will have
                        it's sucky moments, but so is life. It's a great oportunity and thus far the oportunity has givith  me 
                        further oportunities since I got out. Just take my word and go nonner life. You'll thank me later.
                        <br><br>
                        Since I have left the military with my small little family and found myself working as a technician for
                        WalMart. Glad I took the route I did. When I was first looking into work I had a logistics career field
                        in mind. It's what I knew at the time and had since forgot how the feel of the keyboard felt amungst my 
                        fingertips. Luckyly a special someone guided me towards the technology side of WalMart and I've been
                        doing this ever since. For about a year I assisted users with their software issues. Doing it the long
                        way to correct issues. Then I saw a co-worker using PowerShell. He built scripts to automate his job to 
                        make his life easier. Thats where I found myself scripting in PowerShell. Since, I have found myself 
                        developing scripts for my team as well as working within our internal teams development subgroup helping
                        maintain and add to our internal Self-Service website lowering call volumn and allowing for more time on 
                        completing the issues comming through.
                        <br><br>
                        All in all thats the "jiff" of my story on how I got here. Check out my Github, Linkedin and Facebook.
